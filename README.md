# Logistic Regression model for Binary-classification

- [Logistic Regression model from Scratch using Numpy](https://github.com/BENHIMA-Mohamed-Amine/Binary-classification/blob/master/vectorized%20_binary_classification%20_cats.ipynb "Logistic from scratch")

  **Description:**

  I Built, trained, and tested a model that decides if a picture contains a cat or not. I built everything from scratch, using Numpy. I also build a F1 score metric, to see how well the model does. You can find the data I used in the "datasets" folder. Feel free to explore and have fun with the notebook!

- [Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn](https://github.com/BENHIMA-Mohamed-Amine/Binary-classification/blob/master/sklearn_binary_classification_cats.ipynb "logistic regression using scikit-learn")

  **Description:**

  The same problem, but this time I used scikit-klearn to solve it.

- [L layer NN from Scratch using Numpy](https://github.com/BENHIMA-Mohamed-Amine/Binary-classification/blob/master/NN_multiple_hidden_layer.ipynb)

  **Description:**

        I built, and trained a L layer NN from scratch using Numpy, L-1   layer used relu and L layer used sigmoid function.
